\subsection{Guidelines to write a formal report}
\paragraph{Good practices}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A ton appropriate to the specific situation (businesslike, definite, user-friendly)
  \item Directness
  \item Highly specific and concrete words that cannot be misinterpreted
  \item Emphasis on factual data, statistics, and measurable elements
  \item Logical explanations that lead to credible conclusions
  \item Absolute adherence to the conventions of the language in which business is being conducted
  \item Use of graphics to clarify and support prose
  \item objectivity
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Bad practices}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Irony and sarcasm
  \item Emotionally charged words
  \item Liberal use of first and second pronouns
  \item Liberal use of contractions and information
\end{itemize}


\section{Writing a paragraph}
A paragraph has a topic/subject, and a focus/reason.
Background questions to answer to well inform the reader: TODO
\begin{itemize}
  \item What
  \item Why
  \item When
  \item Where
  \item Who
  \item How
\end{itemize}

Once the topic sentence is determined, the text can be developed using explanation, example or an anecdote.
Also, it can be developed using definition, comparison, analysis, hypothesis, negativism, physical description, cause, effect, explanation and data/proof.
To conclude a paragraph or a paper, either the subject and focus can be restated, or a prediction can be made.
