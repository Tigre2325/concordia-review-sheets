# Review sheet Concordia University

Course review sheets for my BEng Aerospace option A classes at Concordia University, Montr√©al, Canada.
Do not hesitate to use them, share this repository to anyone who you think would benefit from them and I wish you a good time at Concordia University.

_Disclaimer: those review sheets are not intended to be a substitute to going to the lectures/tutorials nor to replace the textbooks, they are intended as another support for learning and reviewing concepts with concise explanations_

## How to?

You can download the entire repository as a ZIP file using the green **Code** button and then extract only the folder with the pdf in it.
In the `other` folder, there is an Excel file that I made for thermodynamics and which uses basic formulas seen in class and the open-source thermodynamics tables from [CoolProp](http://www.coolprop.org) (which I believe you would need to install as an [Excel add-in](http://www.coolprop.org/coolprop/wrappers/Excel/index.html#excel)). The pages are locked to prevent unwanted edition of the formulas, but there is no password so you can freely unlock the sheet and mess around with the formulas.

## Background story

I began to make them in LaTeX in order to learn this language which produces professionnal looking PDF files, but now it just because I appreciate way more writing in LaTeX than using Word, especially for very long reports which have a lot of images, tables, references, etc. and it is also easier to maintain a constant formatting.

## Issues

If you notice any typo, overfull hbox (when the text of a line, equation, table or figure goes beyond the margins), or anything that is wrong in the actual content, do not hesitate to open an issue and let me know so that I can fix it for myself as well as for the others that will benefit from these review/formula sheets.

_Note: there are formula sheets that are not finished (hence the TODOs in the LaTeX files), I will try to finish them as time goes on so that they are complete._
